Kind of sucked. 
- git config --list and realize you have the wrong git account
- git config --global credential.helper manager-core <-- next time you push, you need user/pass

- password: my token (should expire in a few days so who cares about saving it here) 
token = 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
