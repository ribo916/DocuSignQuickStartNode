Kind of sucked getting this repo pushed. Too many github accounts on various machines. 
- git config --list <-- realize you have the wrong git account, so fix your user/pass in git command line
- got to macbook and delete all my git items from the keychain
- git config --global credential.helper manager-core <-- next time you push, you need user/pass
- username: ribo916
- password: my access_token from github

-- from macbook pro2
